Hi. My name is Tyler Ivie. I am currently working on developing software for a local start-up and I really enjoy it. 
I am learning to use the technologies I have used in this employment to be able to develop and design a web page for you soon. 
Feel free to look around, check out my resume, look at some designs I have done in work and on the side! Enter your information 
below if you have any questions about what I do and what I can do for you! Thanks for visiting!
